    <p>I started playing the trumpet in the summer before 7th grade. Originally I wanted to play the cello, my dad came home with a trumpet and said, "This was cheaper." Two years after that I joined a jazz program here in Utah and worked my way up to be apart of their top band! This allowed me to travel the world and play at all kinds of festivals such as the one above, in Shanghai, China! </p>
    <p>I've been lucky enough to perform at the Governor's Gala, as well as Best of State here in Utah! Music has helped me be able express emotions that I've never felt before! All because of a small brass kazoo</p>

<p>My skills are only just improving, I was able to get attend college because of my trumpet, and bring joy to so many people around the world through the power of music. I've been able to learn from legendary grammy award winning artists such as Rashawn Ross from the Dave Matthews Band, Tom "Bones" Malone from the SNL band, Robbie Loud from the Killers, and so much more!</p>
